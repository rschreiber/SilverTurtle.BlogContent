# The Homepage on my Next Experiment

## What?

I've decided to put my site together making use of Statiq Web (<a href="https://statiq.dev/web/" target="_blank">found here</a>), so there'll be a number of changes, as well as times where this is broken.

The premise is as follows: 

* I want a blog site that uses only static pages that I'll be hosting on Azure Static Apps.
* I want to be able to write the content using markdown
* I'll use Github to store the raw content
* I'm making use of Visual Studio to build a console app that generates the static site. This will also be committed to Github
* I'll use the console app in a Github Action as part of the build, generate and deploy steps


## Why?

Well, I believe in learning by doing. Rather than putting together the usual "Blog->Post" code sample, I've decided to put together a blog, with posts.

I don't know if this is going to work yet but I'll give it a go. I'll also document everything I'm doing along the way, and open source it all.

## How's it put together?

At the moment, my tech stack consists of (from the OS down):

* Windows 11 Insider (Version 21H2 OS Build 22000.51)
* Visual Studio 2022 Preview (Version 17.0.0 Preview 1.1)
* .NET Core 6.0 Preview (6.0.100-preview.5.21302.13)
* Statiq.Web 1.0.0-beta3

I'm making use of the excellent <a href="https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/" target="_blank">Markdown Monster</a> for editing these files.

That's it for now. Time to get this page up on the web.
